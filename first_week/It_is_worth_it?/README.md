* It is known that in supermarkets, a very confusing time is the time to buy toilet paper, as the same manufacturer sells the same product with different quantities per package. Supposedly, the bigger the package, the cheaper it will be for the customer, however, this is not always true.
* You must write a program that receives the price of the largest package available that contains 24 rolls, and write on the screen what the maximum value that each of the smaller packages must be costing to be cheaper than the informed package.
* For this exercise, consider that manufacturers usually sell packages with 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 rolls.
