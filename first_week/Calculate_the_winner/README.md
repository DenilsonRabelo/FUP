<p5>
  In zerim or an American each participant puts as many fingers as they want on the wheel. One of the participants adds his fingers and points to each participant while counting. The one whose finger points on the last number wins.
  Suppose there are 4 players. The counter, player 1, points up and says "zero", and then points to himself and says "one", points to player 2 and says "two", to player 3 and says "three", to player 4 and say "four", point back to yourself and say "five" and so on until the numbers run out.
